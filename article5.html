    <section class="about"> <h1>About Xtra G⚽ALS</h1> <p> Welcome to <strong>Xtra G⚽ALS</strong> —
         the home of football vibes, wild comebacks, and last-minute heartbreaks! We’re not your regular 
         “copy-paste” sports blog. We live for the drama, the noise, and the beautiful chaos that makes football 
         electric. </p> <p> From the roar of Anfield to the magic under Camp Nou lights, we bring you stories that
             hit harder than a 90th-minute screamer. Whether it’s a tactical masterclass, a shock upset, or a 
             meme-worthy moment, we break it down — with style. </p> <p> Built by fans, powered by passion, 
                and fueled by late-night match energy, <strong>Xtra G⚽ALS</strong> is where football meets fun.
                 No boring recaps — just pure adrenaline, creative takes, and news that keeps you ahead of the whistle.
